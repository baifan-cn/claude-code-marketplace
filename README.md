# Claude Code Marketplace Hub

The decentralized hub for discovering Claude Code plugin marketplaces. Browse multiple community-maintained marketplaces in one place.

Visit the hub at [claudecodemarketplace.com](https://claudecodemarketplace.com)

## What is the Marketplace Hub?

Instead of hosting plugins directly, this hub connects you to multiple specialized plugin marketplaces maintained by different communities. Each marketplace can focus on specific topics, frameworks, or use cases.

**Benefits:**
- üöÄ **Decentralized** - No single bottleneck for plugin submissions
- üéØ **Specialized** - Marketplaces can focus on specific niches
- ‚ö° **Fast Updates** - Each marketplace controls its own plugin listings
- üåê **Community Driven** - Anyone can create and maintain a marketplace

## Create Your Own Marketplace

Want to start your own specialized marketplace? Here's how:

### 1. Create a Repository

```bash
mkdir my-claude-marketplace
cd my-claude-marketplace
git init
mkdir .claude-plugin
```

### 2. Create Your Marketplace Manifest

Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://anthropic.com/claude-code/marketplace.schema.json",
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername"

  },
  "plugins": []
}
```

### 3. Add Plugins

Add plugins to your `plugins` array following the schema. See [Plugin Entry Schema](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugin-marketplaces#plugin-entries) for details.

### 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial marketplace setup"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-marketplace
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Submit to the Hub

Follow the "Submit Your Marketplace" instructions above to list your marketplace in the hub.

## For Plugin Developers

If you want to get your plugin listed, you have two options:

## Important Notes

This hub is a **directory service only**. We:
- ‚úÖ List marketplaces and help users discover them
- ‚úÖ Dynamically fetch and display marketplace data
- ‚úÖ Provide a unified search and discovery experience
- ‚ùå Don't host plugin files
- ‚ùå Don't control marketplace contents
- ‚ùå Don't verify individual plugins (marketplaces do that)

Each marketplace is responsible for:
- Curating and reviewing their plugins
- Maintaining plugin metadata
- Ensuring code quality and security
- Providing installation instructions
